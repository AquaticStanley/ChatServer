have a queue for rolling message window

before client connect clear their window (client program), 
on client connect populate with queue's contents

also log messages to dedicated logfile

monitor effect of closing window and populating with queue contents, have gotten
  extra newlines on occasion but may have been extraneous

channels should be a thing
  -Probably just have a std::map<std::string, std::vector<int>> to store:
  -Actually have a std::vector<Channel>, a channel has a std::string for name 
    and std::vector<int> of FDs located in that channel
    -Also has a broadcast method as well as 
    -channel name, list of FDs in that channel
    -Benefits are being able to look up an FD in the neighboring FDmap to avoid duplicating
      client information
    -When broadcasting, just send to others located in that channel

when adding a new 'kind' of prefix/type of message, must add an entry in the 
  const unordered_map in Server.h as well as a handling function in the
  parseAndVerify function; this is because the way to verify different types is different
    -one idea to automate this is to have a std unordered_map of string, regex
      but it seems unlikely
